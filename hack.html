ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve submitted the four required PRs for the Hacktoberfest challenge! So long as your PRs successfully pass the review period, theyâ€™ll become valid â€” which means youâ€™ll have officially completed this yearâ€™s challenge!
Legend
In Review
Your PR has been accepted by a maintainer and is currently within the review period, which lasts for fourteen days.
Pending
Your PR has not yet been accepted by a maintainer. A maintainer can accept your PR by merging it, adding the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label to it, or approving it.
Invalid
Your PR has been labeled as "invalid" or "spam" by a maintainer and won't count toward winning Hacktoberfest.
Ineligible Repository
Your PR was submitted to a repository that is not participating in Hacktoberfest. Maintainers of the repository can add the "hacktoberfest" topic to their repository if they wish to participate. Alternatively, an individual PR can be opted-in with a maintainer adding the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label to the PR.
Accepted
Good job! Your PR has passed the review period and counts toward completing the Hacktoberfest challenge!
